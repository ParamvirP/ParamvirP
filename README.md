<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Param</h1>
<h4>I'm a computer science graduate,</h4>
<p>I've got QA experience in the field as my first job. I'm looking to transition towards becoming a Jr. Front End Developer. I have knowledge and experience building websites 
and web app platforms in my free time and I'm currently creating a personal project on the side. I also have experience working with HTML, CSS, MySQL, C#, Adobe Photoshop, and 
Figma. As of right now I'm working on furthering my skills with JavaScript to create more intensive and interactive websites.

I'm always eager to meet new people and learn new things. Open to take constructive input from fellow colleagues in the field, to further my skills. Please don't hesitate to reach 
out, would love to connect and share pointers. Thanks!</p>
